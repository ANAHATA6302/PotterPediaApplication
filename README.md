Harry Potter Character Encyclopedia

ðŸŒŸ **PotterPedia**

PotterPedia is an Android application built using Jetpack Compose that lists characters fetched from an API, allowing users to view their info. 
This offline-first application ensures data is available even without an internet connection. 
With a search bar for quick lookups, dark/light themes for personal preferences and scalable architecture, it's designed for an optimal user experience.

ðŸ“± **Features**

Character Listing: View a list of characters fetched from the API on the home screen.
Character Details: Tap on a character to navigate to an info page with more details.
Offline-First: Data is cached locally for seamless offline usage.
Search Functionality: Search characters quickly by their actor name or character name.
Scalable Architecture: Designed for future scalability and feature additions.
Modern Libraries and Tools:
Jetpack Compose: For a modern, declarative UI.
Retrofit: For network requests.
Koin: Dependency injection made simple.
Coil (AsyncImage): Efficient image loading.

ðŸŽ¯ **App Architecture**

PotterPedia is built with a clean, modular, and scalable architecture for maintainability and ease of extension. The core principles include:

Min SDK - 28
Compile/Target SDK - 34
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): Separation of concerns for better testability and maintainability.
Offline-First Approach: Cached data is prioritized for faster load times and offline support.
Dependency Injection: Handled using Koin for a loosely coupled and testable codebase.
Composable UIs: Dynamic and reactive UIs built with Jetpack Compose.
